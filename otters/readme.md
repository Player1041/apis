# Otter Photos API

This API was created because there wasn't any otter photo APIs and it made me and a few others a bit upset.\
so we made one ourselves

https://otter-pics.up.railway.app/

^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It's there, use it in whatever, I don't care what for, just don't paywall it\
also if you're using a discord bot, make sure you append something that's randomized at the end of the url, par example:
```
import time
url = f"https://otter-pics.up.railway.app/?huh={hash(time.time())}"
```
discord cache and all that, blame discord for that\
if you want to add photos, make a fork, add photos to the `otters` folder and merge it.\
